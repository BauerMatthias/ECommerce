- Users starting at random places 
- 3 types (gold, silver, bronze) of users diffrent SLAs and diffrent priority
- Diffrent SLA more CPU / memory usage etc.
- Migration to more energy efficient edges and PMS 
- Normal Distribution of Failures and these failures are normal distributed over all edges (so there are a few edges with few failures and and many failures but many edges with avg. amount of failures)
- Handling of randomized enegry consumption of PM
